# Spring Cloud Stream Binder Redis (deprecated)

This project contains a Spring Cloud Stream Binder implementation for Redis.

This implementation is compatible only with Spring Cloud Stream 1.0 and is deprecated. 

We recommend using one of the binders listed in https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream#binder-implementations instead.
